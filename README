=== HOW TO RUN AND USE THE WEBSITE ===
SIDE NOTES:
We did not use a public domain or public server to host the database. It only works
on a local server via localhost.

To run the website:
 -First, make sure the indiemusicdb folder is in the respective htdocs folder
  in order to run the website properly
	 -Import the indiemusicdb.sql onto the phpmyadmin
	 -You should be able to find this in the mass of files inside the indiemusicdb folder
	 -(This will 'populate' the database with 3 accounts (2 users and 1 admin), some songs, 
	 and some playlists)
 -(the musicuser thing in phpmyadmin that kevin did?)
 -Before running the site, make sure that Apache and MySQL are running with
  whichever database programs you use (for us, we used xampp to run our website)
 -Open a window and type in this to run the website:
	localhost/indiemusicdb/loginPage.php
