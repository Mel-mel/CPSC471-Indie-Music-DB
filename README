=== HOW TO RUN AND USE THE WEBSITE ===
SIDE NOTES:
We did not use a public domain or public server to host the database. It only works
on a local server via localhost.

Do the following first:
 -Unzip folder and move the whole indiemusicdb folder into:
	xampp -> htdocs
 -First make a new database in the phpmyadmin site called indiemusicdb
 -Then import the indiemusicdb.sql onto the phpmyadmin
 
 **Important step**
 -You must create an user account on phpmyadmin. Or else you will not be able to connect
  to the website properly
	-On the phpmyadmin while on the indiemusicdb, go to 'privileges' and do the following:
		-Click "add user account" and type this in:
		Username: musicuser
		Host name: localhost
		Password: password
		Re-type: password
		
		Select all global privileges then press "Go"
 
To run the website:
 -First, make sure the indiemusicdb folder is in the respective htdocs folder
  in order to run the website properly
 -Before running the site, make sure that Apache and MySQL are running with
  whichever database programs you use (for us, we used xampp to run our website)
 -Open a window and type in this to run the website:
	localhost/indiemusicdb/loginPage.php
